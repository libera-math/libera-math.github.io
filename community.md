### About
Libera ##math is operated by a small group of volunteers.
You can find us on the ##math-ops channel.

### Contributing
Feedback on the website is welcome on ##math and ##math-ops, and at [github](https://github.com/libera-math/libera-math.github.io).
The contents of the website can be discussed on ##math; policy and technical issues belong to ##math-ops.

If you have additions, pull requests are welcome, but not required!
An issue is fine.
Alternatively to using GitHub, you can make suggestions on ##math-ops (or on ##math, but that has a higher chance of being lost).
For larger additions, please prepare a pastebin and share a link.
